      <p> Thor was one of the most important and famous gods in Norse mythology. He was the son of Odin and Fyorgyn, the earth goddess. Thor was considered the storm-weather god of sky and thunder and also a fertility god. His wife was Sif, a goddess also linked to fertility. He had a red beard and eyes, he was huge in size, he had an insatiable appetite and not much wit. Thor was the strongest of all gods and men according to The Prose Edda.</p>

	<h3>Character Info</h3>
		
<img src="file://///gph-fs1/studentdata$/pierce.leavengood/My Documents/My Pictures/Thor.jpg" width="375" height="599" alt=""/>
<p>Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people. Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless looked forward to the day of his ascension to the throne. But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of the Asgardians and Lokiâ€™s people, and Odin hoping to teach his son humility divested Thor of his magic hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.</p>
		
<p>Like all Asgardians, Thor possesses great strength, endurance, stamina, and long life, but it is his command over the stormy forces of nature that separate him from his brethren as a true son of Odin the Allfather. Thor can call down lightning and thunder at will and utilize them like a blacksmith uses his tools to work iron and steel bending and shaping them into weapons. Once he believed it was his hammer Mjolnir that granted him these powers, but in truth the ability has rested within him the whole time.</p>
		
<p>Next Summer, Avengers Annihilation will be coming out and Thor will be making his last apperance with the Avengers to face the ultimate foe, the Titan Thanos. </p>
